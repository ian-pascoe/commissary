/**
 * Authenticates a request of a self-hosted Commissary: on the client API (`route` undefined) or the management API.
 *
 * `headers` must expose lowercased header names; `requestUrl` is the full URL as the client sent it (the dev bypass
 * reads its host). Failures use the Go auth middleware wording (`Missing API key`, `Invalid API key`).
 *
 * The identity carries the org of the request (the addressed org, the `CurrentOrg` otherwise) and the caller's role in
 * it. A platform admin is an owner of every org; anyone else needs a role in the org (`403` otherwise), except on a
 * platform-level route.
 *
 * On the client API an API key (`cms_…`, `api-key.ts`) wins: the request is for the key's org, as its member; a bad key
 * is refused even when the request also carries an Access sign-in. Without a key, the Access JWT comes from
 * `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` or, since Access no longer sits in front of the client API, from the `cf-access-token`
 * header `cloudflared` sends; it is accepted only while the org's `access_clients` setting is on. Management routes
 * never take API keys: they stay behind Access, which sets `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`. A management key
 * (`Authorization: Bearer cmsm_…`, `management-key.ts`) wins there the way an API key wins on the client API.
